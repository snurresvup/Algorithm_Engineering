#TraceUtil
This program can be used to extract counter values from .trace files generated by instruments. For the program to work the .trace file must be generated by the version of Instruments bundled with xCode Version 7.2.1 (7C1002).

#Makefile
The makefile provides the necessary targets for compiling the code, and running the ruby scripts for generating the data files use to produce the plots in the figures directory. For the ruby scripts to work the code must be run on a mac computer (because of the above).
