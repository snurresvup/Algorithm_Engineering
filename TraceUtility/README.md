# TraceUtility

A proof of concept on how to parse .trace documents generated by Instruments, using the undocumented frameworks shipped with Instruments.

We only need to link against these two frameworks in `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app/Contents/Frameworks`

* `DVTInstrumentsFoundation.framework`
* `InstrumentsPlugIn.framework`

Instrument templates used by the app are plugins in `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app/Contents/PlugIns`

Such as `SamplerPlugin.xrplugin` for Time Profiler.

The code is short and commented out and I don't need to explain much here.
